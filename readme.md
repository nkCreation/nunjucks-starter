# Fonctionnement

This starter use [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for it's templating engine. To create a page, you have to create a file in the `src` folder with the name of your page. For example `src/my-page.njk`. This will generate a file called my-page.html and you'll be able to access it in your browser.

Nunjucks page example:

```nunjucks
{% extends "./layouts/home.njk" %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Page 1</h1>
{% endblock %}
```
